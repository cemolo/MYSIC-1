# MYSIC
The problem we are solving is that music fans usually attend concerts of artists / bands that they already follow. At the moment there is no easy way to branch out and discover new artists or bands. 

Fans do not have a place where they can find concerts near their location, listen to the artist’s / band’s music prior to the concert and even purchase tickets all in the same place. 

With MYSIC you can do all of this.
